# Hi, I’m Matthew Sayer 👋

## About Me
I’m an **AI Engineer Consultant** specialising in **Agentic AI** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Based near London, I consult in building automations controlled by natural language - bringing productivity increases through AI whilst keeping a human in the loop.

## 🛠️ My Focus Areas
- **MCP infrastructure & agentic frameworks** — enabling AI agents to operate across diverse services  
- **AI-powered tooling** — from data pipelines to autonomous workflows  
- **Enterprise integration** — connecting AI systems to CRM, cloud services, and custom APIs

## Highlight Projects
I’ve been building with MCP and agentic AI—here are some key repos:

- **pylint_mcp** - Provides comprehensive Python code analysis capabilities through MCP tools, including Pylint, Symilar, and Pyreverse.
- **mcp_quick_start_py** - A quickstart template to enable you to build MCP tools straightaway, either run locally with uv or with docker.
- **gene_mcp** – A Model Context Protocol server for genetic analysis using DNA files
- **more to be added**

## 🌐 Tech Stack
- **Main Language**: Python
- **Additional Languages**: DAX, SQL, Front-end (JS, CSS, HTML), Groovy, Rust
- **Platforms**: Power BI, MS Fabric 
- **AI & ML**: Soundhound Amelia, Nvidia AgentIQ and NIMs, IBM WatsonX, Omilia OCP, NICE CXOne, Kore.ai
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Azure, Docker
- **Integration**: REST APIs, MCP
